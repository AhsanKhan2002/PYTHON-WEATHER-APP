# Weather Forecast Application
This web application, built using Flask and the OpenWeather API, provides users with real-time weather forecasts for any city. It features a clean, minimalist user interface designed for seamless navigation and quick access to relevant weather information. The front-end is crafted from scratch using HTML and CSS, employing CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries to ensure a responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile platforms.

## Key Features
- Real-Time Weather Data: Retrieves and displays accurate weather information for user-specified cities.
- Responsive Design: Ensures usability across a range of devices, from mobile phones to desktops, using modern CSS techniques.
- Custom Implementation: All HTML, CSS, and Python code is hand-written, emphasizing a focus on originality and custom functionality.

# Development Insights
Learning Through Implementation
This project was developed entirely from scratch, which required extensive online research and problem-solving to understand and implement core functionalities. Tutorials, documentation, and developer forums played a vital role in helping me integrate the OpenWeather API and structure the application effectively. Key technical milestones included:
- Establishing a connection with the OpenWeather API to retrieve and process weather data.
- Deploying the application using Git for version control and managing sensitive data securely with environment variables and .gitignore.
## Challenges and Solutions
### Responsive Design Issues :
- During development, discrepancies were noted in how the website rendered on mobile devices compared to desktop browsers. Chrome Developer Tools initially provided a foundation for testing, but its inaccuracies for mobile views prompted the use of "Responsively," a desktop application that simulates multiple device screens. This switch helped refine the layout for consistent responsiveness across devices.
